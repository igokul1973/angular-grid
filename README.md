# GridAngular

This project is the outcome of the test task assigned to me by one of the potential employers. The description of the task is in the root of this project in the `test_task_description.pdf`.

The task completion took me about 18 hours. It included reading the documentation on certain Angular aspects, such as interceptor and finding some other solutions published on the Internet, given at the time of this writing I worked very little with Angular in the past two years.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.2.

## Development server instructions

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
